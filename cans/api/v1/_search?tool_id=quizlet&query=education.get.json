        "description": "The theme of education is of strong importance to Cree people in terms of our history and culture. In the early days of the League of Indians, there were great efforts in place by these people to stop residential schools. Indeed, it was one of their key focuses (along with Treaties). I think that these old leaders knew that the issues surrounding residential schools were at the core of Indigenous people regaining our sovereignty and collective well-being. I think of how these leaders would ride horses sometimes for hundreds of kilometers, at a time when Canadian society was very repressive towards Indigenous people. Yet, because of the efforts of these leaders, and also the efforts of our grandmothers who keep us clothed and nourished with clothes and language and medicines, we survived and are now able, in this time, to continue the retrieval of our culture and language.",
